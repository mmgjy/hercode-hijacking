# HerCode Zenline Hackathon

Build a reusable opportunity-detection system for retail.

## Challenge

Your mission is to build a system that detects emerging retail opportunities from global and local market signals.

Use the starter case of a Swiss outdoor retailer to prove that the system works, but design it so the same method could be reused for another industry, market, product category, retailer, or brand.

The best submissions are not one-off research reports. They show a repeatable flow where inputs can change and the method still works.

## Starter Case

Detect promising emerging outdoor retail opportunities for Switzerland or DACH.

Your system should answer:

- What are the emerging opportunities?
- Where is the trend appearing first: US, Japan, Korea, Nordics, UK, DACH, Switzerland, or another market?
- What evidence supports the opportunity?
- Could the trend transfer into Switzerland or DACH?
- What should the retailer test, buy, launch, or monitor next?
- How reusable is the system beyond outdoor retail?

## Event Timeline

- Event date: June 19, 2026
- Meeting point: Zenline AI Office
- 10:00 CEST: Yoga session at the lake
- 10:45 CEST: Challenge reveal, Q&A, and kick-off
- 11:15-16:30 CEST: Build session
- 15:00 CEST: Pre-submission deadline
- 16:30 CEST: Final submission deadline
- 16:30 CEST: Miss Liquid Bar at the lake while the jury evaluates results
- 17:45 CEST: Back in the office for finalist presentations and awards

Teams should have 2-4 people. Discord is the main communication channel before and during the hackathon.

## Required Deliverables

Submit a fork of this repository that contains:

- Your code, scripts, notebooks, app, dashboard, API, or workflow.
- A completed [`SUBMISSION.md`](SUBMISSION.md).
- Clear setup and run instructions.
- Evidence sources used by your system, including URLs where possible.
- A ranked list of detected opportunities with confidence, risks, and next actions.
- An explanation or visualization of your dashboard or tool.
- Optional but encouraged: a short video walkthrough of your tool or dashboard.

Do not commit API keys, passwords, tokens, private datasets, or other secrets.

## Submission Process

1. Fork this repository into your own GitHub account or team organization.
2. Build your solution in the fork.
3. Update [`SUBMISSION.md`](SUBMISSION.md) with your team name, approach, run instructions, outputs, and demo links.
4. Push all final work to your fork before 16:30 CEST on June 19, 2026.
5. Submit the fork URL through the channel or form announced by the organizers.

The jury will review the code and submission artifacts from your fork.

## What You Can Build

You can build any useful part of the opportunity-detection system, for example:

- Custom research agents or scripts.
- Scrapers for retailer, marketplace, social, or publication sources.
- Dashboards or review UIs for ranking signals.
- Notebooks for scoring, clustering, or enrichment.
- APIs that expose normalized results.
- Evidence deduplication, source credibility, or opportunity-scoring tools.
- Report generators that convert structured evidence into a business-ready recommendation.

A strong demo does not need to replace the whole flow. Improving one source, analysis step, scoring module, API, UI, or handoff artifact can be enough if the result is reusable and well demonstrated.

## Suggested Evidence Sources

Combine multiple signal types where possible:

- Web research: publications, brand pages, retailer listings, forums, outdoor events, market articles.
- Search trends: search momentum, rising queries, local vocabulary, and market comparisons.
- Social signals: creator visibility, hashtags, product usage, and weak lifestyle signals.
- Marketplace or competitor scans: product formats, brands, prices, bestseller or ranking hints, and assortment examples.
- Participant/custom data: scraper output, API pulls, notebooks, manual store checks, CSV files, or Google Sheets.

See [`docs/data-contract.md`](docs/data-contract.md) for a recommended output schema.

## Evaluation

The jury will evaluate:

- Signal detection: can the system find a real emerging opportunity from messy sources?
- Evidence quality: are trends backed by sources, not guesses?
- Transferability: does the system reason whether a global trend can work in Switzerland or DACH?
- Business actionability: does the output lead to a clear retail decision?
- Reusability: could the same flow be reused for another industry, market, or category with input changes?
- Technical architecture: is the system robust, understandable, and practical to run during the hackathon?

More detail is available in [`docs/evaluation.md`](docs/evaluation.md).
